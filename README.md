CSC 172 Lab 1
This lab covered a review of Java generics and lambda expressions implementing a functional interface. Various arrays of objects were printed with multiple methods and the maximum value of these arrays was also found with a variety of methods. The PrintArray java file holds the source code for the lab and the OUTPUT file displays the code's output for each step in the lab instructions along with any compile warnings (for a non-type safe implementation of a method).
